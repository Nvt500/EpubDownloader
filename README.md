# EpubDownloader
Takes web novels and puts them into an epub.

Scrapes web novels off different sites converts them into an epub and lets you download them. It also lets you read them in your browser. Is kinda scuffed since the site I used is down but should be expandable to others if the time is taken. Too bad I don't steal time.
